WETS: Marine Corps Base releases [article](https://www.dvidshub.net/news/477291/harnessing-ocean-wave-energy-converter-deployed-mcbh) on [OE35](https://oceanenergy.ie/oe35/) deployment at the [Wave Energy Test Site (WETS)](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Research-Support-to-WETS.pdf). I also [posted a video](https://vimeo.com/994581598) taken at sea along side OE35 post deployment.
