For as long as I can remember, I've lived within a few miles of a major body of water. I grew up in the Finger Lakes region of Central NY on Cayuga Lake, just north of Cornell University. Summers there were defined by how long you could endure the cold lake water, marking the unofficial start and end of the season. In high school, I would intentionally tailor my answers on career questionnaires to lead to "marine biologist" because I never wanted to leave the water. My passion for the water grew even more when my father, who lived in South Florida, introduced me to ocean engineering at Florida Atlantic University. That introduction set me on the path I’m on today. Now, I’m living in Waimanalo, HI, embracing the Pacific with each breath.
